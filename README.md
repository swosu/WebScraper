# WebScraper
This is a web scraper for the website https://www.ratemyprofessor.com

None of the csv's that are built by the code are added
The proper order to run these codes is:
RateMyProfessor_URL_1 - 8 [1-8 can be done at the same time]
RateMyProfessor_Data_1 - 8 [1-8 can be done at the same time]
URL_Compiler 
[I imported the resultant RMP_DATA_Total into a database and used that to remove the duplicates making RMP_DATA_Total_Unique]
TagSort
Compiler

At the end there will be two files, one with the data and one with just the tag numbers.
